    <p class="content">
      This paper explores the growing concern of social media usage and its potential
      impacts on mental health, particularly among teenagers and young adults. The research
      examines various psychological effects, such as increased anxiety, depression, and
      social comparison, as well as potential benefits such as improved social connection
      and support networks.

    <div class="section-title">Research Methods</div>
    <p class="content">
      The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining surveys to gather quantitative
      data and interviews to collect qualitative insights from 200 participants aged 18â€“25.
      Data were analyzed to identify patterns between social media usage and mental health
      outcomes.

    <div class="section-title">Results</div>
    <p class="content">
      The results showed a significant correlation between heavy social media usage and
      increased levels of anxiety and depression. However, the study also found that social
      media usage provided emotional support for a minority of users, suggesting a complex
      relationship between the two.

    <div class="section-title">Conclusion</div>
    <p class="content">
      In conclusion, while social media has undeniable negative effects on mental health,
      it is important to recognize its potential positive aspects. Future research should
      focus on strategies to mitigate the risks while enhancing the benefits, such as
      promoting healthy usage patterns and improving digital literacy.
